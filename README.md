# BugReport.ButtonVisualState
The demostration of one of MAUI's bug associated to Button's VisualState.

Just simply press the two buttons and see the difference.
The correct behavior can be achieved by the using a Clicked event handler, but it's definitely a bug, not a feature.
Depending on this workaround is ugly and unnecessary.
